== Description ==
This plugin will display notifications to shop customers about products they have already bought before with information that is customization . 

Like order number, order date and custom text. Basic idea is to encourage customers to buy the same item again and again or the opposite, depending on what the shop is selling.

Example, if shop is selling various car parts and their main customers are repair garages they would like to see items that they have bought before and do a repeat order or if shop is selling collectible items and usually customers would like to have just one item of each they would be notified of what items they already have.
Plugin has 3 different ways of notifications.
